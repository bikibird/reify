# reify
Reify is a system for creating web-based works of interactive fiction (text adventures) and blurs the lines between parser, choice, and drag/drop based interactive fiction. 

Reify features a semantic network, an event driven plot management system, and a dynamic text generation system.  

Reify is currently under development.  An alpha version is scheduled to be released April 2026.
